### Hey, what's up? My name is Jeffrey Calimbahin.

I was born on June 11, 1999.

I am currently working on my senior design project as somewhat of the lead programmer on the team (Considering I am the only CompE major among 4 EE majors)

My knowledge of coding is honestly very basic since I am actually more concerned with the core mathematic aspects of it.
This got to a point where I even considered switching my major to mathematics entirely, but a part of me is glad I didn't

I also really enjoy playing video games which is what led me to want to pursue a career working with some kind of video game related technology.
I am currently very fascinated with virtual reality despite being too broke to own a VR set up.
